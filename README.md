### Program 1: random_number_math_game.py

This Python program is a fun quiz game that tests your math skills! Here's how it works:  

1. **Generate Random Numbers:** The program starts by picking two random numbers.
2. **Choose a Random Operation:** It then randomly selects one of five math operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), or modulo (%).
3. **Ask the User to Solve the Problem:** The program shows the math problem to the user and asks for an answer.
4. **Check the Answer:** If the userâ€™s answer is correct, their score is incremented by 1.
5. **Show the Total Score:** At the end of the game, the program displays the user's total score.
